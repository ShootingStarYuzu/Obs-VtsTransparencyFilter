# OBS Plugin: VTS Transparency Fix

This plugin fixes the following problem:

Even when enabling a transparent background in VTube Studio the background color "bleeds" into the transparent parts of the model.
This plugin removes this "bleeding" effect as good as possible (for now) such that the original model colors are kept intact even when having semi-transparent areas.
See below for a comparison between using OBS with VTS with transparent background color and the same configuration with this filter applied.
